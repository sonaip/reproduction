The 10,000 hour-rule might be controversial in bringing out the best of you, but no one could deny the importance of sufficient practice. To achieve a debut of recital for a pianist, a twenty-year training is expected.As well as craving for exceptional skills, how to maintain to be good is equally important, especially in the temporal estimation. It is not affordable to be good just once in a while, for example, during a Formula 1 race competition, a minor mistake will lead to a life-threaten situation. 

In terms of the estimation of sensory information, Weber’s law provided us a widely accepted law in describing the sensitivity of perceptual estimaion, where the  the linear relation between sensory estimation and the variance of the corresponding magnitude. As is also referred to as the scalar property(some important papers) within temporal estimation, this law also predicts a constancy of relative precision of estimation: the standard variation in estimation divided by the mean estimation, where the term coefficient of variance(CV) was defined[1].

CV = Std / Mean     (1)

Previous studies in investigating CVs of interval timing, revealed various results. For example, within different ranges of durations, numbers of stimuli, different methods in approaching the estimations, etc…(several papers should be added here:

)

In 1997, Gibbon et al. collected the values of CVs from several studies, where the pattern of CVs intended to be found. ‘Jumps’ in CV was found where different mechanisms of interval timing from different ranges were indicated, at approximately 0.1 and 1.5s. In consistence with this hypothesis over a larger range of intervals,  Lewis et al tested human reproduction of temporal intervals in a range from 68ms to 16.7min, where continuous decrease of CVs against temporal intervals was found. 
Instead of illustrating the constancy of CVs in all cases, several studies showed the violations of constancy. 

Hypothesis

As well as focusing on investigating the effects of different approaches, the range of durations also yields differences in CVs. 
However, we doubt about the conclusion that the violation of the fundamental percept of timing was found, since temporal context plays an important role in affecting the precision of perception but rather by violating the general law where the standard deviation scales with the temporal intervals. 

what we do
- adopted reproduction task, tested same intervals ranging from() in two conditions.
what we expect to get: decreasing trend disappear in the block conditions

In order to isolate the influence of temporal context,  we tested the same intervals in two conditions: Mix condition and Block condition. Under the Mix condition, all the intervals were mixed together and tested within one block, while under the Block condition, all the intervals were divided into three groups: short, medium and long, and tested separately.
